                A recipe is a set of instructions that describes how to prepare or make <br>
                 something, especially a dish of prepared food. A sub-recipe or subrecipe <br>
                  is a recipe for an ingredient that will be called for in the instructions for the main recipe. <br> <br>
                  A sub-recipe or subrecipe is a recipe for an ingredient that will be called for in the instructions for the main recipe. <br> <br>

                Sub-recipes are often for spice blends, sauces, confits, pickles, preserves, <br>
                jams, chutneys, or condiments. Sometimes the sub-recipe calls for the ingredient <br>
                to be held for several hours, overnight, or longer, which home cooks sometimes find <br>
                frustrating as it means the main recipe cannot be made in a single session or day. <br>
                Sub-recipes discovered late and calling for an ingredient the cook doesn't have on <br>
                hand means a special shopping trip or trying to find a substitute. <br> <br>

                Sub-recipes, and the cookbooks that contain them, are often described as not being <br>
                 targeted at casual cooks. Reviewers have mentioned finding alternate uses for leftover sub-recipes. <br><br>
